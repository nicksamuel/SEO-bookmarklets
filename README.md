# SEO Bookmarklets
A collection of Javascript Bookmarks aka "Bookmarklets" for SEOs in order to speed up daily checks, audits, analysis and routine SEO tasks.

## About

The concept of bookmarklets has been around for a number of years. By the time I started by first agency job in 2013 when I graduated these were already fairly common knolwedge:

With the rise of powerful and freely available Chrome and Firefox extensions "bookmarklets" kind of fell out fashion for a while, and I never really paid them that much attention for quite a few years. 

This changed last year when one day my colleague at Havas, Aleks (https://twitter.com/aleks_radecka), "randomly" shared a cool one she uses for highlighting on-page elements.

And then coincidentally a week or two later Glen Alsopp aka Viper Chill published a pretty definitive guide which gained a lot of traction on SEO twitter (https://twitter.com/cyrusshepard/status/1119080261793112064):

Anyway, a year later...I started a new role and was chatting about them at work and I thought it would be fun to round-up the ones that I have bookmarked and occasionally use myself.

## How to use

There's two main ways depending on how they are saved/presented on a page:

1. Drag and Drop
2. Create a new bookmark - save JavaScript code in "location" section.

In the case of the examples in this repo, I've saved them all in a JavaScript file so you will have to manually copy/paste and create new bookmarks.

## FAQs

**Did you create all of these bookmarklets?**

No, most of them were created by other people around the web.

I'd love to cite every unique source of each Bookmarklet but it's not really practical.

A good majority are based on the same piece of JavaScript code which basically appends the current URL in the browser tab as a parameter onto a pre-defined URL.

I don't think any individual can take credit for that :-P

**Can you share this snippet?**

```javascript:location.href='https://www.example.com/siteurl?='+window.location```

**Can you share this snippet again but as a full example?**

This one was straight from the Detailed.com guide :-P

```javascript:location.href='https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/#url='+window.location```

**Will they work for Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge/Other Browser?**

I *think* so...

Try them out and you should know if they work very quickly or not...

Hopefully it goes without saying, but you're gonna be out of luck for any specific Chrome functions e.g. Clear Cache.
