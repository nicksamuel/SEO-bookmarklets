# SEO Bookmarklets
A collection of Javascript Bookmarks aka "Bookmarklets" for SEOs in order to speed up daily checks, audits, analysis and routine SEO tasks.

## About

The concept of bookmarklets has been around for a number of years. 

By the time I started by first agency job in 2013 when I graduated these were already fairly common knolwedge. Hell, a quick Google for "SEO Bookmarklets" reveals hundreds of results with Moz publishing this in August 2011 (https://moz.com/blog/some-nifty-seo-bookmarklets-to-make-you-more-efficient) and an excellent three part series by Ann Smarty in Search Engine Journal in Novewmber 2008 (https://www.searchenginejournal.com/9-google-bookmarklets-for-seos/8068/)..

Hell, there's even this one which is supposedly from 2004 (https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/more-seo-bookmarklets.html) which cites Propeler.net which is one of those old-school names I recognize in SEO but have no idea what they do, besides I think they are based in Brighton *shrugs*.

Anyway, with the rise of powerful and freely available Chrome and Firefox extensions "bookmarklets" kind of fell out fashion for a while, and I never really paid them that much attention for quite a few years. This changed last year when one day my colleague at Havas, Aleks (https://twitter.com/aleks_radecka), "randomly" shared a cool one she uses for highlighting on-page elements.

And then coincidentally a week or two later Glen Alsopp aka Viper Chill published a pretty definitive guide which gained a lot of traction on SEO twitter:

Anyway a year later...I started a new role and was chatting about them at work, but realised I didn't really have them saved in a centralised place. Until now :-D
